## Personal Log inspired by Instagram

This project is a personal log inspired by Instagram, leveraging Next.js. The home feed features a 3-column grid layout sourced from static data, where each image links to a dedicated detail page. To create a more comprehensive profile, I added curated sections for film and music, incorporating an embedded Spotify playlist.
